### How should you code a Binr App?

Well, making app just consists of coding to provide the desired functionality.
Just ensure your Backend part is working fine.
Run <code>studio.sh</code> and enter the required enquiries

    ~$ bash studio.sh -path/folder -app.bind = True

Make sure you have designed your <code>studio.bind</code>

    # Run binding for Binr;
    output = ....../path_for_file;
    backend = ....../ Python_files/main.py;
    front = ......../web_files;
    encryption = True;

### While opening the App for first time why does it take so long?

Yes, though the App takes very much time on the first open.
This is due to the <code>post-install</code> requirements.

Similar to others. If any wrong Application is downloaded by user then it might lead to Misuse.
This might have potential to harm the users.
Though we have make a Filter system to remove Malecious and Suspecious files user must be careful for what's been installed.

Binr Apps shows weather the App is been Verified or Not. If not then user must take his own risk to perform these actions.
